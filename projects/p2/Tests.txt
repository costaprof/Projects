### First Test:
The IDs of processes that are executed in the background are saved, and they are displayed when using the `ps ax` command, but the IDs of foreground processes aren't displayed.

### Second Test:
Another shell suggests corrections and informs you that there is no such command. In contrast, our shell simply returns the error value from `execvp`, which is: "No such file or directory." The original shell, however, has more advanced methods for handling exceptions and errors.

### Third Test:
If applications/programs are executed in the background, the original shell opens them, but our shell does not.
